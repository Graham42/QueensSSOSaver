# QueensSSOSaver

This is a chrome plugin intended to improve easy of use for Queen's many services, that require
going through their SSO and were users have to re-login far too often.

Note: We have no affiliation with Queen's University.

## How to set up

Log in once and then whenever you visit any of the supported sites the plugin will automatically
redirect and take care of the login.

Current sites the plugin handles login for:
  * moodle.queensu.ca
  * my.queensu.ca
  * outlook.com/queensu.ca


# License

We chose GPL because we're using a GPL library.
